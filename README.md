# BD-RTL (BetterDiscord Right-To-Left)

**BD-RTL** is a BetterDiscord plugin + theme combo that makes Discord chat layout more natural for **Right-to-Left (RTL)** languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, etc.).  
It repositions avatars, aligns messages, and automatically adjusts text direction for a smoother reading experience.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Restart Discord if changes don’t appear immediately.
- The plugin works best with cached messages after scrolling; make sure to scroll up/down once if layout seems off.
- Use together with the theme for full styling consistency.
- Alter to your needs, as the plugins may have not been aimed to look the best but to make channels and chats
more readable when using an RTL based language
